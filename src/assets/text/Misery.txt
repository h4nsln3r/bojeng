Recorded live in a barn deep in the forests of Fyledalen, this track captures a raw and honest energy we didn’t want to polish away.

“I'm Your Misery” is about emotions that never really go away — the quiet ones hiding in the back of your mind.
They creep in when you least expect it.

It's the first track from our upcoming EP, out August 8th.

Come say your prayers
I've got demons to spare
Come take my hand
And all the falsehoods for which I stand

I'm your Misery
I'm inside your mind

Take me in your mind
Let me poison all that makes you kind
You will see me again
But I'll never tell you when

I'm your Misery
I'm inside your mind
I'm your Misery
I'll take my time

Sense me coming
A familiar taste
Let me in darling
And I will teach
I will teach you the way

I'm your Misery
I'm inside your mind
I'm your Misery
I'll take my time
I'll take my time
I'll take my time
